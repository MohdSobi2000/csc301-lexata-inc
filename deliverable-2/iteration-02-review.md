## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

1. **Trello Board and Scrum Methodology:** We decided to use the Scrum Methodology and use Trello as our task board. The first week that we were working on the project after deliverable 1, we did not have these methods and tools in place and we would simply split up tasks in our weekly meeting and work individually on these throughout the week. Without the Scrum Master and Trello, it was difficult for team members to keep track of which tasks had already been completed and which tasks were available or needed doing. We also had a slow start to the project because we would decide that certain team members would work on front end, back end and database, but we wouldn't outline the tasks in detail which left a lot of members unsure of how to proceed. With the Scrum method and Trello, each member was able to see exactly what others were working on, how these pieces fit together, and there was a centralised place where detailed descriptions of new tasks could be found for anyone that was unsure how to proceed. Below we included a screenshot of our Trello board at the end of Deliverable 2.
2. **Members working with a tech stach that suited their skills and interests:** We split our group into sub-groups working on different aspects of the project (front end, back end code/database, integration) based on what areas people were interested in and familiar with. We decided to only have one person work on the front end since this member has a lot of front end experience and our front end was a minimal amount of work that could be done by one skilled member. Another aspect of this decision was that we only had one member who really enjoyed working in the front end. This was a good decision in the end. The front end member really enjoyed the work and was able to manage the workload while the rest of the members could work on areas that they enjoyed a lot as well. This decision kept each member engaged and interested in the project. We believe this increased contribution, enthusiasm and communication of each member.
3. **Decision of how to run meetings and communicate with our Partner:** We decided to have a 1 hour meeting every week with the entire team and the partner. We also produced meeting agendas for each meeting and kept extensive notes throughout the meeting. We decided to include the entire team in these for a couple reasons. Our partner really values harbouring a sense of community and allowing each member of the team to have a voice. During these meetings, every member would contribute and our partner enjoyed that aspect. We also thought it would be easier to work towards a product that the partner was happy with if every member heard from them personally about their vision of the product and was able to ask for clarification on aspects of the product they were working on. This decision proved to be a very good one. Throughout our work, every member had a clear understanding of what our partner asked us to build and there was no confusion or misunderstandings of what to implement. We also have a very good relationship with our partner, and we each feel some personal connection to, and therefore accountability for, the project through our conversations with our partner on their vision and the mission of the company.
4. **Getting to know each other and meeting in person:** At the beginning of this project, we decided to have some casual zoom calls to get to know each other and become comfortable together. When the covid restrictions were lifted, we also decided to meet in person and work on the project together on campus. We believe that getting to know your team members is really important when working on such a large project with a big group. This was a great decision. Through these methods, we became comfortable and friendly with each other and as a result, we are more comfortable communicating any issues we have, whether that means asking for help, disagreeing with methods and proceedings, or any other conflict. We are also more comfortable expressing our ideas and contributing to group discussions. Building a good team dynamic created more of a sense of accountability for each of us. By being engaged with the team members, we form a relationship where we don’t want to let our teammates down. This is also a contributing factor to the good communication and contribution from every team member.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. **Git Flow:** Our git flow throughout this deliverable was inconsistent and messy at first. We did not clearly decide on a git flow that would be uniformly adopted by all members, so when we began working on the project, some people were creating new branches for every feature they wanted to add, some were simply working in the same branch the entire time. No one knew what other team mates were doing. This was unorganised and a big mistake. By the end of our deliverable we all recognized this issue and communicated with each other about how to proceed and what git flow to adopt. We then adopted the git flow described in the README, and were much more organised in our collaboration.
2. **Poor communication on work division at first:** At the beginning of our project, before we adopted the Scrum method and used Trello, we did not have very good communication on how to divide the work and what tasks needed to be done. We split the team up into which areas of the project we would be working (i.e. front end vs back end), but beyond that, everyone just started doing work. As a result, some team members were unsure of what tasks to work on or what tasks were already being completed. It was very unorganised and certain members had a hard time getting involved in the project at first because of this. Even when we started using Trello, our team members were not keeping the Trello board up to date so there wasn’t very good communication over which tasks had been completed and what stage the project was in. 
3. **Deciding to have the first retro after the deliverable:** We decided to have our first retro after we submitted the deliverable. We made this decision because the entire team was very busy in the week leading up to the deliverable, however in retrospect, it would’ve been beneficial to make some time for this. It would’ve even saved us time, since we could’ve discussed some problems and organisational issues earlier on and adopted more efficient, effective methods of working together. 


#### Q3. Planned changes

1. We plan to modify our git flow. We will have a branch called develop that holds the most up-to-date code. Anyone working on a new feature will create a new branch for that feature. Once the feature is tested, we make a pull request to merge that branch with the develop branch. At the end of our work cycle (i.e. for the deliverable), we merge the develop branch into the master branch. We plan to use this git flow uniformly throughout our team and communicate with each other so everyone knows the git standard we are setting. These branches will reflect Trello tasks. That way, the Trello board can be a guide to our repository’s organisation, and if any member wants to look at a certain change that is in development, they can use the Trello board to find the corresponding branch. 
2. We plan to have another weekly meeting, in addition to the weekly meeting we have with our partner. This meeting will be to update the rest of the team on what each member has completed, so that we can all have a good idea of what stage our project is in. Since our website is almost entirely a backend project, a lot of our team members are working on similar areas and so, this meeting with the entire team can also be a time for people to ask for assistance, and members to offer to help with tasks others are stuck on. We will also use this meeting as a retro, to reflect on the organisational aspects of our progress. Adding this meeting will hopefully address the issues outlined in (2) and (3) of the previous question.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 
To prepare the demo, we deployed our website and ensured all tasks were complete and bugs were fixed. We tested our website and rehearsed what we would present to the partner.
We demo-ed our website so far to the partner. This included the home page of the website, the search functionality of the website, and the privacy and contact pages. For the search functionality, we demo-ed some search queries and outputs, letting the partner read the top 3 search results.
Our partner accepted the features and was very impressed.
Our partner requested we change the format of displaying the search results to include more information in the header. For the rest of the demo, we discussed next steps with our partner and current issues we are having and they helped us figure out the best steps forward and what to focus on. 
We learned that it’s important to update your customer on the progress in design and GUI during the development process, in addition to updating them on the technical and functional aspects of your product. When we showed our partner the prototype design, they had no comments on the GUI and thought it looked great. But when we actually developed the website, they were much more specific on how they wanted the data to be presented. We had been ignoring the design in our weekly meetings with the partner and we learned it is important to focus on this aspect of the project just as much as the technical aspects.
