The core user interface of our app will be very simple, as our project will mainly focus on developing a new back-end search. The website will be centered around a search page, where users enter natural language search queries and get back the search results produced by our back-end. On the results page, the user can choose to read more about each result, and will be presented with a well-formatted version of the legal text. Links will also be provided to the original document on the respective government website.

Our partner has an existing website, available at the given URL (the following is **not** our work): https://lexata.ca/. Our product will involve recreating a subset of the features on the existing page (those mentioned above), which will work alongside the newly-designed back-end search.
